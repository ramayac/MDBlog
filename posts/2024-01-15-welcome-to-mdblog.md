# Welcome to MDBlog!

This is your first blog post in **MDBlog** - a simple, static blog system powered by Markdown and PHP. 

## Features

MDBlog comes with several great features out of the box:

* **Simple Markdown parsing** - Write your posts in Markdown
* **Static generation** - No database required
* **Pagination** - Built-in pagination with 25 posts per page
* **Code highlighting** - Perfect for technical blogs
* **Custom JavaScript** - Add Processing.js sketches or other scripts
* **Responsive design** - Looks great on all devices

## Getting Started

To create a new blog post, simply:

1. Create a new `.md` file in the `posts` directory
2. Add front matter with title, date, and other metadata
3. Write your content in Markdown
4. Upload and refresh - that's it!

## Code Examples

Here's some sample PHP code:

```php
<?php
echo "Hello, World!";
$name = "MDBlog";
echo "Welcome to $name";
?>
```

And here's some JavaScript:

```javascript
function hello() {
    console.log("Hello from MDBlog!");
}
hello();
```

## What's Next?

Start writing your own posts! Just drop Markdown files into the `posts` folder and they'll automatically appear on your blog.

*Happy blogging!*
