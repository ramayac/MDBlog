# Working with Code in MDBlog

One of the great features of MDBlog is its excellent support for code examples and syntax highlighting.

## Inline Code

You can include `inline code` using backticks. This is perfect for mentioning variables like `$username` or functions like `getData()`.

## Code Blocks

For larger code examples, use fenced code blocks with language specification:

### PHP Example

```php
<?php
class BlogPost {
    private $title;
    private $content;
    
    public function __construct($title, $content) {
        $this->title = $title;
        $this->content = $content;
    }
    
    public function render() {
        return "<h1>{$this->title}</h1><p>{$this->content}</p>";
    }
}
```

### JavaScript Example

```javascript
// Processing.js sketch example
function setup() {
    size(400, 400);
    background(220);
}

function draw() {
    fill(255, 0, 0);
    ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 50, 50);
}
```

### Python Example

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Generate first 10 Fibonacci numbers
for i in range(10):
    print(f"F({i}) = {fibonacci(i)}")
```

## Best Practices

When including code in your posts:

1. **Always specify the language** for proper syntax highlighting
2. **Keep examples concise** and focused on the concept you're explaining
3. **Add comments** to explain complex logic
4. **Test your code** before publishing

## Conclusion

With these tools, you can create technical blog posts that are both informative and visually appealing!
