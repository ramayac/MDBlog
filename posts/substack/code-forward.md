Welcome to the inaugural issue of "Code Forward," a newsletter dedicated to exploring the latest trends and best practices in software development. Whether you are a seasoned developer or just starting out in the field, I hope that you will find the content valuable and inspiring.

In general I will be diving into a range of topics related to software development, including new technologies, methodologies, and strategies for building high-quality software.

If I can, I’ll try to feature interviews with colleagues, team members and whoever says ‘yes’ to this idea.

I’ll add a little bit of myself here and there, personal opinions and ramblings, don’t worry I’m not that controversial but I do have some weird interests, a wandering curiosity is a thing to treasure I tell myself these days.

So join me as I explore the newsletter medium and engage again in practicing giving an opinion on the Internet on the things that makes us go forward in our career.

My honest hope is that you will find "Code Forward" to be a valuable resource and a source of inspiration for your own work, team or career. See you soon.
