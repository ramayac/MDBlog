### ... not one, but TWO wholes year later, and I didn't write *shit*.

Well it takes a while, but I just better start doing instead of just planning.

I think the error for my HUGE gap in writing was just that I some times do things out of boredom. To get some small bump in dopamine.

This time, I’m doing this with discipline, and honesty.

I miss writing, I regret losing my old blog (srbyte). I wish I had the discipline to continue doing it.

I don’t think this is ‘the second chance’ of it, in fact it’s not a chance at all.

But what I can say is that, I just need to stick to it. If you’re interested to follow up the struggling rambles of a grumpy almost 40 yo migrant software developer. Hit subscribe and let’s hope I actually do something consistent this time.

PS: I will, but I have to make it sound like it’s a dramatic up hill battle.
