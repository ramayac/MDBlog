It’s that time of the year again, where people makes reflections on the past and look forward to the future. We’ll do resolutions for the coming year, eat healthier, exercise more or learn something new being the usual.

One thing I don’t see too much in social media posts is about ‘wanting more’, not material stuff of course, I believe with all my heart that the less you own the happy you are.

I’m talking about wanting more:
- Time (the most limited resource we have)
- Physical and Mental Health (health is wealth)
- Love (make friends or just improve the relationships with my loved ones)
- Wins (I want to feel like I’m winning in this ‘game of life’).

Since this is not a matter of just wishful thinking, I have to lay out a simple plan on how to achieve these.

## How will I get where I want to get, what is my plan?

### Time:
First quarter of 2023 I’ll keep tracking everything I do in my electronic devices, I’m currently using RescueTime to do this. I will add some goals to what I want to achieve in terms of productivity and usage of unnecessary distractions (like social media).

### Additional things I’ll be doing:

Removed social media apps: mastodon, TW, FB, BeReal, TikTok, Reddit.

Remove streaming apps from phone: Netflix, YouTube, Disney+, HBOmax, etc.

Limit time on the apps I like in my phone: 45 min for Instagram (you can do this using ‘Digital wellbeing’ apps, here is a good list you can check in case your interested).

Absolutely no games on the phone.

Reduce total usage of phone to 2 hr (I have this statistic from my digital wellbeing app, my daily average is 2:30 - 2:45 h)

Finally I’ll be doing a general schedule in my Google calendar, and I’ll become completely subject to it. Will double check with the wife about it, because I want to have the most quality time I can with her, which is not just watching Netflix series :)

Overall, sounds like a good plan right?

Tomorrow I’ll tell you all about my plan for Health. Thanks for reading!
