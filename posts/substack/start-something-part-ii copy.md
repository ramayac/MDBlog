My general goals for 2023 are based on the idea of ‘wanting more’:

- Time (the most limited resource we have)
- Physical and Mental Health (health is wealth)
- Love (make friends or just improve the relationships with my loved ones)
- Wins (I want to feel like I’m winning in this ‘game of life’).

You can read about '[Health](https://codeforward.substack.com/p/start-something-part-ii)’ in my previous post, now it’s time for:

## Love:

I’ve been thinking a lot about this one, and I guess I have it figured out. Took a while, here is my take on this goal:

First, let’s clarify I’m using the ‘Four Loves’ categories discussed by C.S. Lewis on this 1960 book of the same name, these are:

- **Storge** - Empathy bond (Family)
- **Philia** - Friend bond (Friends)
- **Eros** - Romantic love (Wife)
- **Agape** - Unconditional love (God).

So, for each I want a realistic and concrete goals:

1. **Storge**:
   1. I want to make sure my family knows that I love them.
   2. I want to improve my family bonds, spending more time with them and getting to know them more.
2. **Philia**:
   1. Identify clearly the existing and friendships that I have.
   2. Actively make the time and pursue this friends, clearly stating that you just want to spend time with them (seems harder to make and keep good friends as time goes by).
   3. Clearly saying you care to your friends, and actively showing them your appreciation.
3. **Eros**:
   1. Schedule date nights with the wife, at least once a month (kind of lost track of that last year).
   2. Be more spontaneous!
   3. Make us feel more like a team, for example: always try to keep the chores of the house well distributed/balanced.
   4. Say ‘I love you’ more! (yes, even more!).
4. **Agape**:
   1. Start going to church again (this is long needed and overdue)
   2. Pray more (should be schedule in my tyrant of a calendar)

Love is such a huge and personal subject, each time I think about this I felt hesitant to share, but since the audience is so small, what’s to fear? Also, that help me made very clear and succinct goals, so I’m happy how this one turned out.

Next issue is ‘Win’, see you there!
