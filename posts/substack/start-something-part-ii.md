My general goals for 2023 are based on the idea of ‘wanting more’:

- Time (the most limited resource we have)
- Physical and Mental Health (health is wealth)
- Love (make friends or just improve the relationships with my loved ones)
- Wins (I want to feel like I’m winning in this ‘game of life’).

You can read about '[Time](https://codeforward.substack.com/p/start-something-goals-for-2023)’ in my previous post, now it’s time for:

## Physical and Mental Health:

First quarter of 2023… get ready I have a lot to unpack here:

#### Physical:

- I’ll set up a schedule (based on Time), to jog 2 or 3 times per week.
- Days I don’t jog I should be doing at least 30 min of cardio.
- I’ll start fasting again: I have to fine tune then when and the why, but last time I was fasting I was pretty damn happy with the practice. I still can’t overcome the 24h of fasting, and it’s a long time goal to do a 72h fast. I’ll keep you posted.
- On the same topic of fasting, maybe I just need to eat two times a day, I’m looking forward to experiment on that… or maybe just do light dinners? There is this idea of having the right meal in sync with the eating patters of your biological clock, this is called ‘[Chrono-nutrition](https://www.firstpost.com/health/chrono-nutrition-how-to-lose-weight-by-scheduling-your-meals-7530871.html)’, as usual do your own research.
- Limit to 1 Cup of coffee per day.
- Implement new mantra for drinks is: **I don’t drink my calories**. No more flavored drinks, juices, iced teas, frappes, sodas, etc.
- Avoid food with flour! (bread, pizza, burgers, pasta, etc)
- Avoid cheese! (I’m lactose intolerant, I don’t drink milk but I love cheese, this is going to be hard!!!!)
- Do a reset on alcohol drinks habits (Don’t drink for 30 days for example).

#### Mental:

Short but hard takes on why I want for my mental health:

- Schedule time for distractions/relax, funnily enough making time and ‘protecting’ it by putting it in a schedule helps me relax during that allocated time and helps me visualize if I’m just ‘all work and no play’. Having fun is just as important as learning/working, so you have to give it the same importance (by adding it to a schedule).
- Read more and practice more Stoicism (this includes reading more books about it, a particular series I enjoy is made by Ryan Holiday, he’s writing about the cardinal virtues (Prudence, Justice, Fortitude, Temperance) from the Stoic perspective: [Courage is Calling](https://www.amazon.com/Courage-Calling-Fortune-Favours-Brave-ebook/dp/B08Q25N6R4/), [Discipline is Destiny](https://amzn.to/3GIA9Z6) (and two more to come!).
- Go to Mass more often, Religious practice has become more and more important thru time, so I do have to include it in since it’s part of ‘who I am’.
- Respect my schedule for sleeping.
- No checking phone 1st hour of the day.
- Order my spaces (it’s a reflection of your state of mind).
- Meet again with friends, and make some new if possible!



Ok, that’s it, it’s not that fancy, but I feel it’s critical foundation for 2023.

Let me know what you think thanks for reading! see you on the next post where I talk about ‘Love’.
